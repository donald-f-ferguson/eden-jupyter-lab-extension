# Project Eden: Test jupyter-lab-extension

## Overview


## Instructions

- Following instructions from: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_tutorial.html

- Some issues. I think I resolved with:
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43916440/error-loading-jupyter-notebook-extensions
  - conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_nbextensions_configurator 
  - conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

- Also had to enable extensions from the console (lab home page).

- __For iterations ...__:
  - jlpm run build
  - pip install -ve .
